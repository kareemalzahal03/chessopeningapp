  <h2>Features</h2>
  <h3>Interactive Chess Board</h3>

    The app provides an interactive chess board where you can explore various
    chess openings. You can set up any position you want, move the pieces
    around, and analyze the resulting positions. This feature allows you to
    experiment with different moves and understand the consequences of each
    move.

  <h3>Theory Arrows</h3>
  <p>
    To guide you through the chess opening theory, the app includes the ability
    to draw arrows on the board. These arrows represent known theoretical moves
    in specific positions. By visualizing these moves, you can understand the
    strategic ideas behind them and gain insights into the opening variations.
